Hi,

This is a simple shooter game that I have been working on for about 3-4 weeks. This is my best independent project so far as of 05/01/2023. 

To add/fix:
  online multiplayer
  local 2 player (point system based on num of enemies killed and least deaths);  
  end world size after EXIT tile; 
  improve animations and sprite designs;  
  fix grenade bug: if grenade thrown at edge of game window and then player moves past the game window, the grenade bounces up and down before exploding
